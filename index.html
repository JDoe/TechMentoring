						A little background on me - my name is Jennifer Wadella, and you can tweet at me @likeOMGitsFEDAY. 
						<ol>
							<li>I work as a Front-end developer at a local startup called MindMixer. I went to school for graphic design and business management. I thought I wanted to be a creative director. Hah. No. I fell into web development by accident, and having been loving life (almost) every day since.  </li>
							<li>In 2013 I decided I wanted to meet more lady-devs, so I founded Kansas City Women in Technology. It's interesting being the only woman in the room, hence my founding of a more specific developer community.</li>
							<li>CoderDojoKC is a free program that teaches kids how to code, and is another developer community. </li>
							<li>Tech Ed Advocate - Shawnee Mission CTE Advisory board, Girls in STEM committee member, planning committee for Girls in STEM conference</li>

						"Because there were so few university courses in computing in the early days, IBM set up the Manhattan Systems Research Institute in 1960 to train its own employees. It was the first program of its kind in the computer industry. The three-month program included courses in computer engineering, software programming and designing systems to solve particular customer problems.""

						<p>IBM was fundamental in the creation of computer science programming, because they had the need for these employees. If we want to create a sustainable workforce, this is a model to adapt.</p>
