						<aside class="notes">
							In 1834, Charles Babbage began his work on the Analytical Engine. While he was never able to secure government funding to build it, it layed the groundwork for fundemental concepts used in computer science today.  The Analytical Engine was designed to calculate any number based on inserted punch cards using two fundamental ideas - the "mill" and the "store". Today we know those as "CPU" and "memory".

						<aside class="notes">
							Though computers didn't technically exist at the time, Ada Lovelace is credited with being a pioneer of computer science. She wrote the first algorithm in history, which  theoretically would calculate numbers on the Analytical Engine. Ada described how to use punch cards to enter number. She was a revoluntionary thought leader with the foresight of what computers COULD do, and understanding of the possibilities that entailed. Her predictions indcludes the use of computers to create music and graphics, and have scientific uses.

						<h2><span class="large">1946</span> First computer science class</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Columbia offers one of the first academic-credit courses in computing.</p>
						<img class="fragment" src="images/benwood.jpg" />	
						<aside class="notes">
							We're going to jump through history now - into the 1900s. IBM has created a computing machine, but lacked people with the knowledge to use it. In 1928 two gentlemen meet, one - Thomas Waston Sr., a chief executive of IBM, the other - Benjamin Wood, a professor at Colombia. Wood was the university's head of educational research, and had taken an interest in automating test scoring. In hopes of achieving this, he reached out to various machine companies, but only heard back from IBM. Wood, upon meeting with Watson, explained to him the possibilies of using machines for more than just mathmatics and calculations, and an intrigued Watson donated the requested machines. This relationship was the foundation for one of the first computer science education endevours.

						<aside class="notes">
							In the 90s, internet startups began. They grew rapidly and in large frequency, the investors invested heavily, in turn leading to a large economic boom. Unfortunately, much of this was due to excitement of possibilites, rather than actual business models describing how profit would be made. Large sums of money were invested in companies without a business plan, simply due to the fear of 'missing out'. Eventually investors realized their pursuits were loss-making companies and backed out and left companies in a state of burnt-through venture capital funds. Remaining jobs became widely outsourced, and computer science lost popularity and sustainability as a career path in the US.   

							And yes, we've reached the reaction gif portion of the presentation.

						<p>I'm not going to spend much time going over currently industry growth and the lack of bodies to fill jobs, I feel that's beating a dead horse at this point. We're going to talk about how mentoring can tackle that issue.</p>

					<h2>Current Curriculum</h2>
					<img src="images/why-numbers-so-bad.png" />
					<p><small>Source: Code.org database of local computer programming schools, sourced by a combination of data from the College Board, the Computer Science Teachers Association, and individual teacher submissions.</small></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						9 out of 10 schools don't teach computer science. Many of them are still attempting to itegrate teach keystrokes and the Microsoft Suite into the curriculum. Those that do have attempted to use free in-browser programs like Scratch and Alice to demonstrate programming. A few even teach java. One thing I haven't seen in any stats are how many of those schools teaching computer science have a computer science teacher. 

						When I was in high school, and I'm not THAT old, mind you, I taught my computer class. Our wrestling coach couldn't be bothered to read the text book to understand how the program worked, and besides, computers were hard. I would read the lesson plan during one of my free hours, play on the computer to be sure I could execute, and then instruct the class. Finally I would circulate the room, having my patience tried by those who didn't find the program as intutive as I did. For frame of reference, this 'program' was photoshop. 

						Code.org has created a fantastic movement pushing to get computer science taught in schools, and both schools and goverments seemed to understand the importance. However things get muddled in the execution ...

					<p class="fragment current-visible" data-fragment-index="0">"Because there were so few university courses in computing in the early days, IBM set up the Manhattan Systems Research Institute in 1960 to train its own employees.

						<p> I mentioned the Manhattan Systems Research Institute in that little history lesson, but I want to spend more time discussing that concept. </p>
						<p>IBM was fundamental in the creation of computer science programming, because they had the need for these employees. If we want to create a sustainable workforce, this is a model to adapt.</p>
						<p>It's funny, this title is called "the future of technology education", but a more appropriate title would probably be 'returning to technology education'.</p>
						<p>It wasn't always that technical education was in the hands of a government-regulated education system. Sure, we've been learning reading, writing, and 'rithmatic since the dawn of a 1 room schoolhouse(I'm just referring to US history, by the way), but trades were learned from parents and employers. Children and teenagers learned from adults in their community how to do more than add 2 + 2, but how to run a shop, how to stable horses, or sow seeds for crops.</p>
						<p> In his essay, Why Nerd Are Unpopular, Paul Graham actually visits this concept of when teenagers being useful memebers of society, vs. today, where high school is toned down demonstration of Lord of the Flies. But let's look at teenagers today, or maybe even the teenager you were. No responsibility, no bills to pay, and plenty of time. And with those who engineerishly-inclined, much of that time may be spent on a computer.</p> 
						<p>Why are we abandoning this workforce that just needs a little guidance?</p>
